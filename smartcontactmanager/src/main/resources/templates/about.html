			<h2>Project Technology Description</h2>
			<p>This projects are developed in SpringBoot with the help of theameleaf.
				This is a learning Project, the main Objective of this project to create an application 
				which stores contacts in very efficient way and provides a smarter way of handling contacts
				with fully Authentication and Authorization. 			
				We created this project using Spring Boot Thymeleaf
				with MVC Architecture and for Authentication and Authorization we have used Spring Security.			
				Spring Boot is used to develop back-end and Spring Data JPA is used for performing 
				Database CRUD operations.HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Thymeleaf as template Engine is 
				used to develop the front end, MySQL for Database.
				
			<h2>Contact Management</h2>
				On the dashboard, users can add new contacts by clicking the "Add Contact" button.
				
				To update an existing contact, click the "Edit" button next to the contact on the contact list page.
				
				To delete a contact, click the "Delete" button next to the contact on the contact list page.
				
				<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
				The following enhancements can be considered for future development:
				
				Contact Categories: Allow users to categorize contacts for better organization.
				
				Import/Export Contacts: Enable users to import and export contact lists.
				
				User Profile: Implement user profile settings and customization options.
				
			<h2>For Usr to run this Project..</h2>
			
				For someone who wants to run this application in their IDE's 
				can simply download and run this without any changes in configuration.
				As i have used MySQL for DATABASE it will generate a .db file as database. And you don't even need a username & password.

			<p><h2>Introduction</h2>
				In today's fast-paced world, managing contacts efficiently is essential. 
				This project aims to develop a Smart Contact Manager using the Spring Boot 
				framework for backend development and Thymeleaf for frontend rendering. 
				This web application simplifies contact management by providing features for adding,
				 updating, deleting, and searching for contacts.
				
				<h2>Project Overview</h2>
				The Smart Contact Manager is designed to make it easy for users to manage their contacts.
				 Users can perform the following tasks:
				
				Add Contacts: Users can add new contacts with details such as name, email, phone number, and address.
				
				Update Contacts: Existing contacts can be edited, allowing users to modify contact information.
				
				Delete Contacts: Users can remove contacts from their list.
				
				Search Contacts: The application provides a search feature to find specific contacts quickly.
				
				<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
				The technology stack used for this project includes:
				
				Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for building web applications quickly and with minimal configuration.
				
				Thymeleaf: A server-side Java template engine for web applications that allows seamless integration with Spring Boot.
				
				Spring Data JPA: For simplifying database access using Java objects.
				
				MySQL: The database system used to store contact information.
				
				HTML/CSS: For the user interface design.
								
				<h2>Search Contacts</h2>
				Search for contacts by name, email, or phone number.
				5. Architecture
				The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern:
				
				Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In this project, it includes contact entities and database access.
				
				View: The presentation layer that displays the user interface. Thymeleaf templates are used to render HTML pages.
				
				Controller: Handles user requests, interacts with the model, and updates the view. Spring Boot controllers manage the flow of data.
				
				<h2>Implementation</h2>
				The implementation of the Smart Contact Manager involves the following steps:
				
				Database Setup: Create the MySQL database and define the Contact entity.
				
				Spring Boot Configuration: Configure Spring Boot for database connectivity and security.
				
				Thymeleaf Templates: Design user interface templates for adding, editing, and listing contacts.
				
				Controller Logic: Implement controller classes to handle CRUD operations.
				
				User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality with Spring Security.
				
				Search Functionality: Add search functionality using Spring Data JPA queries.
